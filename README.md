# GraphQL Server
Schema-driven development. It all starts with extending your schema definition with the new operations that you want to add to the API.

## Prisma
Prisma lets you easily connect the GraphQL resolvers in your API server with your database.

After every change youâ€™re making to the datamodel file, you need to redeploy the Prisma API to apply your changes and migrate the underlying database schema.

### "prisma deploy"
Updates the Prisma API

### "prisma generate"
Updates the auto-generated Prisma client so that it can expose CRUD methods.

### Post-deployment hook
The Prisma client will automatically be regenerated upon a datamodel change.
